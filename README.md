# Unique-Number
Takes your name and outputs a number based on ascii.

It fist splits the first and last name into two vaiables. Then it goes through each convirting them to their ascii equivalent and returning the sum of them.

Once both steps are complete it will then add together the first name sum with the last name sum and output the total revealing the unique number.
